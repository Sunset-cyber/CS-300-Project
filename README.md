# CS-300-Project
Work from SNHU CS 300 Data Structures and Algorithms Class

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
We were solving how to make it easier for advisors at a fictional university to access course information for their students by implementing either a vector, hash table, or binary search tree.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I approached the problem by identifying conducting runtime and memory analysis to identify which data structure best solved the problem.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
Whenever I ran into a roadblock, I referred back to the assignments we did. Much of the assignments had templates that did a good job explaining step by step how to implement the different data structures. Microsoft Visual Studio also offered help by way of its copilot feature helping me to debug and identify other errors that could have taken a lot of time to find manually.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
It has helped me become more aware of the importance of using the right data structure for the task at hand. Conducting a thorough analysis, creating detailed pseudocode, and developing test cases are all critical steps to creating a robust and complete program.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I have gotten more practice organizing the program in a more logical way, taking the time to write robust pseudocode helps to connect with the side of your brain that processes the English language (more practiced) so your head feels less cluttered when you are working out how to organize your methods in a way that makes logical sense to a third party.
